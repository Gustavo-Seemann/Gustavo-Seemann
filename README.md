<p align="left" width="65%"> I craft digital interfaces focused on your users and your business. I solve the tough problems so you can focus on yours. My mission is to breathe life into a wide array of ideas and solutions through code and design. 

I’m a Frontend Developer with a strong startup background, experienced in building, evolving, and refactoring digital products from concept to production. I’ve worked professionally as a Frontend, Fullstack, and UI Developer, contributing across the full product lifecycle, from early ideas and Figma designs to production-ready code.

I have deep expertise in Vue.js, but I’m comfortable working with any modern frontend framework. I’ve built complete platforms from scratch, led large-scale refactors of legacy systems, and helped modernize products used daily by real customers.

Beyond frontend development, I have experience with Node.js and Python for backend tasks, and I’ve also developed and maintained WordPress and Wix projects. I apply modern development practices such as TDD, E2E testing, cloud services, and agile methodologies, and I’ve taken part in technical leadership, project coordination, and direct collaboration with clients and stakeholders.

I enjoy working in collaborative environments, taking ownership of problems, and delivering scalable, well-structured, user-centered solutions.</p>
